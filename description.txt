3. save and continue to the following steps

Run scenarios

Run one specific scenario

    s.run_one_scenario(scen_no, results_only=[False, True]) 
    (0 = baseline)


Run all scenarios

    s.all_results()

save scenarios

Save one specific scenario

    s.save_one_scenario(scen_no, results_only=[False, True])

Save the summary of your results 
    
    s.save_results() 

Save your entire project

    s.save_everything()
    

Use from command line

Features

Examples of policies that can be modelled through the software:

- sharing
- recycling
- life extension
- rebound effects
- substituion
- market and value added changes
- efficiency

The tables in which it is possible to apply changes:

- total requirement matrix (A)
- intermediate transactions (S)
- final demand (Y)
- primary inputs coefficients (RE)
- emission intermediate extentions coefficients (RBe)
- material intermediate extensions coefficients (RBm)
- resource intermediate extensions coefficients (RBr)
- emission final demand extension coefficients (RYBe)
- material final demand extension coefficients (RYBm)

It is possible to specify:

- region of the intervention
- whether the intervention affects domestic, import transactions or both



Important modules


pycirk.py

1. Initiates the operations to set scenarios and to create IOT from SUT based on prodxprod Industry-Technology assumption both under Market Share Coefficient method and Technical Coefficient method.
2. From start you can launch all the analysis specifications listed under scenarios.xls and save everything
3. Results will be saved in the output folder

Permitted SUT transformation Methods:
	- method = 0 >> Prod X Prod Ind-Tech Assumption Technical Coeff method
	- method = 1 >> Prod X Prod Ind-Tech Assumption Market Share Coeff method

Results options:
	- results_only = True >> output only results (spec'd in scenarios.xls under analysis)
	- results_only = False >> output all IOTs and results
	- scen_no = 0 - n (0 = baseline) 
	- n = is number of scenarios specified by sheet in scenarios.xls
	- "scenario_1" is also allowed for scenarios
	- None, 0, base and baseline are also accepted for baseline

Aggregation types:
	- aggregation = ["", "bi-regional"](bi-regional EU-ROW), None (Multi-regional 49 countries)

Availability of secondary raw materials in IO:
	- make_secondary = False (regular database), True (modifies SUTs so that secondary raw materials are avaialable in IO after transformation)


scenarios.xls

From this .xls file it is possible to set different types of interventions and the analysis to perform:

- matrix = specifies in which matrix of IOT the changes are applied
- intervention = Primary and ancillary are only used to specify the type of intervention from a conceptual level
- reg_o or reg_d = Regional coordinates (o=origin or row, d=destination or column)
- cat_o  or cat_d = category (e.g. products or extensions ) coordinates (o=origin or row, d=destination or column)
- kt = technical change coefficient (max achievable technically); a negative value means reduction; unit = %
- ka = absolute values for addition
- kp = penetration coefficient (level of market penetration of the policy); unit = %
- copy = allows you to copy a specific transation to a different point in the matrices (useful for proxy creation)
- substitution = tells the software whether it needs to substitute values among specified categories
- sk = which intervention should be substituted
- swk = Substitution weighing factor (how much of the original transaction should be substituted); allows to simulate difference in prices and physical properties between categories; unit = %

These can be set for:

- product category e.g. C_STEL (basic iron), C_PULP (pulp), etc.
- final demand category e.g. F_HOUS (households), F_GOVE (government), etc.
- primary input category e.g. E_HRHS (employment highly skilled), T_TLSA (taxes less subsidies), etc.
- emissions extensions e.g. E_CO2_c (CO2 - combustion)
- material extensions e.g. NI.02 (Nature Inputs: Coking Coal)
- resource extension e.g. L_1.1 (Land use - Arable Land - Rice)

Furthemore, from the analysis sheet you can set the following variables to be compared in the analysis:

- product categories
- primary input categories
- emissions extensions
- material extensions
- resource extensions
- region of interest
- impact categories Please see the data_validation_list sheet in the scenarios.xls file for the comprehensive list

make_secondary.py
Allows for the modification of secondary material flows in the SUTs so that they are visible in the IO system
